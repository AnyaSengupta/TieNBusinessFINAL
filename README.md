TieNBusiness helps small businesses fight COVID to be BackNBusiness!

Over 100,000 small businesses have shut down due to COVID-19. Employees are leaving, 
the amount of customers are diminishing, and many are struggling to keep their heads 
above water. Our team, Anya, Karen, and Vanshika, decided to create TieNBusiness, a
website that allows small businesses to reach out to volunteers who can help them 
with their web development, management, and other needs!

To began, small businesses will create an account, so that they can have a profile, 
which will include information on what the business needs help on. When 
volunteers go to the search bar, they can see what is needed and help accordingly. 
Another option is that volunteers can bookmark certain keywords such as web development 
in a certain location and when a business fullfills those filter, the volunteer will 
get a notification shown here. Through TieNBusiness, we want to help out small businesses
who are fighting an uphill battle against COVID-19. 

We created TieNBusiness using the languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
in the application Brackets. We used a CSS file for the design of the whole website
(colors, fonts), added content using HTML, and JavaScript for the animations. We pushed
to GitHub and used GitHub to host our public link for the internet.

To improve our prototype, we would use PHP to use the user input for logins and 
searchbars, but none of us had experience. We would also create a page for the 
volunteers to reach out to the businesses.
